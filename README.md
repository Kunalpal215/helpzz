## Setting up project on your machine ‚öôÔ∏è
- [Follow this guide](https://swciitg.notion.site/Day-1-f6ea19b1d7ff410e8ec03683772f4cd0) to setup Android Studio & Flutter SDK on your machine

## üé™ Running application
```
- Run "dart pub get" command to download all the dependencies used in this project.

- To run the application on a Physical device/Virtual Emulator use command "flutter run" at the root of this project's directory.

```

# üñºÔ∏è Some glimpse of the App

# Why Flutter over React.js ü§î ?
- Although, in assignment It was mentioned to use some frontend framework like React.js still, I chose to build a mobile application using Flutter as I have more experience working with Flutter as compared to React.js. Although, I have worked with React.js on several projects but have less worked with designing complex screens.

# üé® Design

- I choose Node.js & Express.js for building backend APIs and have used various npm packages.
- Followed [MVC (Model View Controller) Architecture](https://www.w3schools.in/mvc-architecture) for separtion of different components and scaling can be done easily and [best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) on backend.
- Used [MongoDB's Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try4?utm_source=bing&utm_campaign=search_bs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core_prosp-brand_gic-null_apac-in_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=415204524&adgroup=1208363748749217&msclkid=469ecde79b84176ced50ae8523e6cc01) database which is a very popular & scalable database in market.
- Followed proper [folder structure & best practices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flutter-file-structure/) to develop different components on application side.
- Why built separate backend service instead of integrating services like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) ?
    - Integrating Firebase SDK in Flutter causes the app to perform slow compared to directly making API requests to your server.
    - Also, now application & backend's code remain separated and development can be done easily, scaling application & backend side.
    - Most modern applications follow same practice of separating their different services.
- Used [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package for State Managment in the application. integrating it gives:
    - reduced boilerplate over a new class every time.
    - simplified allocation/disposal of resources.
    - increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially in complexity (such as ChangeNotifier, which is O(N) for dispatching notifications).
- Login/Signup APIs: Tokens like Access & Refresh tokens are used for proper connection between user, server side and avoid chances of token fishing by hackers but due to time constraint, in this project, a 'security-key' header is passed with every API call to avoid unauthorized access.
- Image upload & Nudity detection: Although, both functionalities could have been implemented on application side but, added them on server side to avoid load on user's device of making extra API calls and also, [Sharp Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) has been used to compress the uploaded images efficiently and it is better than packages available on pub.dev in performance.

# üßõ Regrets
- I should have used Typescript instead of Javascript in backend because of various advantages.
- If time would have persisted then, I would have implemented full proof Authentication flow as mentioned before.
- For allowing only registered users to create buy/sell entries, I could have implemented biometric registration in the app and confirming the same before form submission.
